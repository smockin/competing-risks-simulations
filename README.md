# Assessing methodological utility of the sub-distribution hazard model in patients with short a follow-up period in the setting of competing risks

The objective of this study was to examine the accuracy of estimated quantities of a sub-distribution hazard model in various scenarios of the follow-up period of patients with various competing risks namely in-hospital mortality, discharged(after attaining clinical stability), discharged against medical advice, referred, and absconded.
<br>Model quantities were examined through extensive set of Monte Carlo simulations.
